========================Mugen Multiverse 720p 1.1 Kireishito edit =============

Original Screenpack: Duracelleur
Original Lifebars: V-Nix
Edition by: Kireishito

This is Duracelleur's Mugen Multiverse Screenpack heavily edited screenpack. I decided to make it public because some people were asking for it, so... why not?
First of all, I'd like to thank such nice guys that are Duracelleur, creator of the original screenpack and many other nice mugen assets like all those chars that surely we all have and V-Nix who created such a nice livid, animated and not-seen-before lifebars; for letting me use their creation to make this edit.

Features:


-Cleaner main menu without hero sprites;
-615 character slots (expanded from original);
-9 hidden slots (Bottom-right of screen)
-Stage thumbnails (as the original);
-Changed "Random" icon;
-HD lifebars (edited by me - some sprite cropping, retrieved the bottom sprite saying "Net Play" and changed the "training mode" that appeared when using notime limit and put a stylized infinity symbol. The sounds are original from Duracelleur's lifebars);
-Custom main menu, select screen and versus screen bgm.

To make the stage preview thumbnails:

Those thumbnails are set as if they were fonts. Each letter of that font instead of showing a writing symbol (a, A, b, B etc.), it displays a picture.You just have to edit the xstages.sff located in "font" folder and change the preview picture already used (actually those are the stages I currently have) and create a thumbnail of your own (personally I found easier to make with paint.net, although more resourceful people should use photoshop or any other nice image editor). Then, you have to look for a table correlating the ASCII code with numbers e.g.: sprite index "33" corresponds to the ASCII symbol "!" so, all you have to do is change the stage name (or displayname) as "!" and use the sprite 0,33 of xstages.sff to place its corresponding thumbnail.
